# Extensible Markup Language (XML)

The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a profile of [SGML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language) that has been designed for ease of use on the Web. While XML is designed to represent structured information, the concrete vocabulary used in XML documents is not part of XML itself, but instead defined by vocabularies using languages such as DTD or XSD. Because of this, XML itself has very little built-in semantics, and thus is rather rudimentary in terms of hypermedia features.

XML exists in two versions ([XML 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/) and [XML 1.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/xml11/)), but these versions [only differ in ways that do not matter for their hypermedia features](http://www.w3.org/TR/xml11/#sec-xml11), and thus they are both covered in the same format description.
