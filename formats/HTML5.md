# Hypertext Markup Language 5 (HTML 5)

Strictly speaking, [HTML 5](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/) is one specification of the core markup language, which is accompanied by a substantial (and still evolving) set of supplementary specifications. However, in practice all of these often are collectively referred to as *HTML 5* (here is [an overview of the current landscape](https://github.com/dret/HTML5-overview)). For this reason, the description found here is based on this set of specifications, and not just on the single HTML 5 core specification.
